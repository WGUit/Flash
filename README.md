#A simple flashcard program

##A WGU Student Collaboration Project

See current issues for unimplemented user stories, and feel free to add more, or decompose what is there.

Any and all WGU students (present or former) are welcome to participate, I'm hoping this can be a friendly way that we as a community can help each other build software using common industry tools, but without the perceived pressure of contributing to "real" projects.

##Contributing

The master branch is protected in order to enforce code review and participation. In order to get started with contributing, you will need to fork the project or work in a named branch on the main repo. I suggest forking. 

For more about how this conceptually works, [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) is a decent overview of various git workflows. The "Forking Workflow" is how we'll be working.

After setting up your own fork, make changes, additions, fixes until you are at a reasonable point to present your work to others. Then, submit a [pull request](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request) the community repository. Someone *else* will need to review and approve your code at that point, although pull requests can be a great place for conversation about code.

This about the most basic explanation possible, so please feel free to ask in the community [Slack](https://wguit.slack.com/) if you have questions about how to contribute or participate.
